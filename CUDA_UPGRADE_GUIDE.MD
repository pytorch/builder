# CUDA Upgrade Guide/Runbook

So you wanna upgrade PyTorch to support a new CUDA? Follow these steps in order! They are adapted from the CUDA 11.3 and CUDA 11.2 processes.

## 0. Maintain Progress and Updates
Make an issue to track the progress, for example [#56721: Support 11.3](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/56721). This is especially important as many PyTorch external users are interested in CUDA upgrades.

## 1. Modify scripts to install the new CUDA for our Linux containers.
There are three types of Docker containers we maintain in order to build Linux binaries: `conda`, `libtorch`, and `manywheel`. They all require installing CUDA and then updating code references in respective build scripts/Dockerfiles. (**Code reference**: [PR 719](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/719), [PR 720](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/720), and [PR 724](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/724), [PR 888 done for 11.5](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/888))
1. Modifying [`install_cuda.sh`](common/install_cuda.sh):
    1. Find the CUDA install link [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&=Debian&target_version=10&target_type=runfile_local)
    2. Get the cudnn link from NVIDIA on the PyTorch Slack
    3. Run the `install_113` chunk of code on your devbox to make sure it works.
    4. Check [this link](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/) to see if you need to add/remove any architectures to the nvprune list.
    5. Go into your cuda-11.3 folder and make sure what you're pruning actually exists. Update versions as needed, especially the visual tools like `nsight-systems`.
2. Add setup for our Docker images in respective `libtorch`, `conda`, and `manywheel` scripts/Dockerfiles:
    1. For `conda` and `libtorch`, the code changes are usually copy-paste. For `manywheel`, you should manually verify the versions of the shared libraries with the CUDA you downloaded before.
    2. To test that your code works, from the root builder repo, run something similar to `export CUDA_VERSION=11.3 && ./conda/build_docker.sh` for the `conda` images. You can extend this to the other images.
    3. Push the images to Docker Hub. This step should be automated with the help with GitHub Actions in the `pytorch/builder` repo. Make sure to update the `cuda_version` to the version you're adding in respective YAMLs, such as `.github/workflows/build-manywheel-images.yml`.

## 2. Modify code to install the new CUDA for Windows
**Code reference**: [PR 728](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/728) and followup fixes in [PR 751](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/751), [PR 755](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/755), and [PR 806](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/806)
1. To get the CUDA install link, just like with Linux, go [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exe_local) and upload that `.exe` file to our S3 bucket [ossci-windows](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/ossci-windows?region=us-east-1&tab=objects).
2. To get the cuDNN install link, you could ask NVIDIA, but you could also just sign up for an NVIDIA account and access the needed `.zip` file at this [link](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download). First click on `cuDNN Library for Windows (x86)` and then upload that zip file to our S3 bucket.
3. NOTE: When you upload files to S3, make sure to make these objects publicly readable so that our CI can access them!
4. Most times, you have to upgrade the driver install for newer versions, which would look like [updating the `windows/internal/driver_update.bat` file](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/commit/9b997037e16eb3bc635e28d101c3297d7e4ead29)
    1. Please check the Driver Version table in [the release notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html) to see if a driver update is necessary.

## 3. Update MAGMA.
Compile MAGMA with the new CUDA version.
1. Our linux CUDA jobs use conda, so we need to build magma-cuda113 and push it to anaconda. (**Code reference**: [PR 721](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/721)).
    1. Currently, this is mainly copy-paste in [`magma/Makefile`](magma/Makefile) if there are no major code API changes/deprecations to the CUDA version. Previously, we've needed to add patches to MAGMA, so this may be something to check with NVIDIA about.
    2. To push the package, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/tree/master/magma#pushing).
    3. NOTE: This step relies on the conda-builder image, so make sure you have pushed the new conda-builder prior.
2. Our windows jobs download MAGMA binaries from our S3 `ossci-windows` bucket, which means that those binaries need to exist.
    1. Lucky for you! There is a GitHub Actions workflow (as of [PR 762](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/762)) that automates this upload when you update `windows/internal/build_magma.bat` to deal with your new CUDA version. Also remember to update the `cuda_version` in `.github/workflows/build-magma-windows.yml` to be the new version. (**Code reference**: [PR 751](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/pull/751))
    2. NOTE: this step should occur AFTER you update the Windows builder code so that the new version is installed correctly.

## 4. Add the new CUDA version to OSS CI.
Testing the new version in CI is crucial for finding regressions and should be done ASAP along with the next step (I am simply putting this one first as it is usually easier).
1. If the new CUDA version requires a new driver (see #1 sub-bullet), the CI and binaries would also need the new driver. Find the driver download [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/) and update the link like [so](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/commit/fcf8b712348f21634044a5d76a69a59727756357).
    1. Please check the Driver Version table in [the release notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html) to see if a driver update is necessary.
2. For Linux, we need to update code to use the magma we built! This can be done in the same PR when you actually add Linux CI, but here's an independent example for 11.2: [PR 50559](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/50559)
3. The configuration files will be subject to change, but usually you just have to replace an older CUDA version with the new version you're adding. **Code reference for 11.2**: [PR 51888](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/51888) for Linux and [PR 51598](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/51598) for Windows, and **code reference for 11.3** where we just replaced verbatim yaml and updated magma for conda for Linux: [PR 57223 for Windows](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/57223) and [PR 57222 for Linux](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/57222)
4. It is likely that there will be tests that no longer pass with the new CUDA version or GPU driver. Disable them for the time being, notify people who can help, and make issues to track them (like [so](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/57482)).

## 5. Add the new CUDA version to the nightly binaries matrix.
Adding the new version to nightlies allows PyTorch binaries compiled with the new CUDA version to be available to users through `conda` or `pip` or just raw `libtorch`.
1. The difficulty in this task is NOT changing the config--you only need to modify this [line](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/.circleci/cimodel/data/dimensions.py#L6)--but the debugging process that ensues.
2. Since this change should not touch other build jobs and it is very likely you would be running these jobs on the CI frequently, I'd advise reducing the config to only the build jobs for the new CI version and to use your own fork of `pytorch/builder`. **Code reference**: [PR 57522](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/57522).
3. Don't be afraid to ask questions when you're stuck on any bug!

## 6. Add the new version to torchvision CI.
Torchvision is usually a dependency for installing PyTorch for most of our users. This is why it is important to also
propagate the CI changes so that torchvision can be packaged for the new CUDA version as well.
1. A code sample can be found in [PR 4248](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/pull/4248) of the torchvision repo.
2. Almost every change in the above sample is copy-pasted from either itself or other existing parts of code in the
builder repo. The difficulty again is not changing the config but rather verifying and debugging any failing builds.

Congrats! PyTorch now has support for a new CUDA version and you made it happen!
